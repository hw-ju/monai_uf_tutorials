#  Step-by-step Tutorial: use MONAI Label & 3DSlicer on HiperGator
## **Notes** ##
1. If you're new to UF Open OnDemand (OOD), please refer to this [HiperGator wiki page](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Open_OnDemand) to learn about how to use it, which will help you understand the following steps.
2. Modify paths to your own paths in commands and scripts used in this tutorial when necessary.
3. In this tutorial, for the server part, we're using a read-only Singularity ([HiperGator wiki page](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Singularity)) container for MONAI Label v0.3.2 pre-built on HiperGator by UF Research Computing. MONAI Label has new release every several months, so if you want to use the latest/a particular version, you can modify and use this sample script [build.sh](./build.sh) to build your own MONAI Label Singularity container. 
```
sbatch build.sh
```

See output (sample output [build.sh.job_id.out](./build.sh.job_id.out)):
```
cat build.sh.job_id.out
```   

Change the path to a MONAI Label Singularity container to your own path in this tutorial.

## **Major steps**
0. Download this repository to use included scripts.
1. Explore and download sample applications and datasets.
2. Launch a console session on the HWGUI nodes in Open OnDemand.
3. Start MONAI Label server and client 3DSlicer.
4. Use MONAI Label server and client 3DSlicer to annotate data & train models.

## **step 0. Download this repository to use included scripts.**
*Note: you can complete this step in an Open OnDemand terminal as well.*

In a local terminal, login to HiperGator, change `hju` to your username

```
ssh hju@hpg.rc.ufl.edu
```

Go to your home directory 

```
cd ~
```

Download this repository to use the included scripts
```
git clone https://github.com/hw-ju/monai_uf_tutorials.git
```

Make all files in /monai_uf_tutorials executable
```
chmod -R +x ~/monai_uf_tutorials
```

## **step 1. Explore and download sample applications and datasets**
*Note: you can complete this step in an Open OnDemand terminal as well.*

Go to directory /monailabel which includes scripts for this tutorial
```
cd ~/monai_uf_tutorials/monailabel
```

to list all commands available for MONAI Label server, all available sample applications and all available sample datasets, use sample script [list.sh](./list.sh):
```
sbatch list.sh
```

See output: 
```
cat list.sh.slurm_job_id.out
```

Sample output [list.sh.18594406.out](./list.sh.job_id.out).


To download sample applications and sample datasets to blue/red partition on HiperGator (don't put large dataset in your home directory), use sample script [download.sh](./download.sh).  
```
sbatch download.sh
```

To see output: 
```
cat download.sh.slurm_job_id.out
```

Sample output [download.sh.18587413.out](./download.sh.job_id.out).

## **step 2. Launch a console session on the HWGUI nodes in Open OnDemand**
In your local web browser, go to https://ood.rc.ufl.edu to login to UF OOD. *Note: you'll need to use VPN to open the OOD link above if you're off campus.*

Click `Interactive Apps`, then click `Console`:
<img src="./screenshots/OOD_console_session.png" width="800">

Fill in the form. 
In field `Cluster partition`, choose `hwgui`. 
In field `Generic Resource Request`, put the number of GPUs you want to use. By defualt, MONAI Label triggers distributed training on all allocated GPUs.
Sample filled form:

<img src="./screenshots/OOD_form1.png" width="400">
<img src="./screenshots/OOD_form2.png" width="400">

Once your job starts, set `Compression` and `Image Quality`, and then click `Launch Console`. Sample setting:

<img src="./screenshots/OOD_compression_imagequality.png" width="400">

## **step 3. Start MONAI Label server and client 3DSlicer**
In the OOD console, load required modules: 
```
module load qt/5.15.4 slicer/4.13.0 singularity
```

Run `3DSlicer` in the background, and direct output to file `log-client` for debugging purpose: 
```
Slicer > log-client 2>&1 &Â 
```
Sample console output:

<img src="./screenshots/console_start_3DSlicer.png" width="400">

Note: For issues regarding 3D Slicer, please refer to Slicer UFRC wiki page (https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Slicer).

Once `3DSlicer` opens up, switch back to the console tab. We'll come back after setting up the MONAI Label server.

Edit the configuration file of your chosen application to e.g., set label names, whether use pre-trained model, choose active learning strategies. The configuration file is in directory `/apps` where you downloaded the sample app. To open a configuration file, click `Files` on your OOD page, navigate to it, and then click `edit`:

<img src="./screenshots/OOD_Files.png" width="400">

<img src="./screenshots/edit_config.png" width="400">

For example, you can modify `true/false` in the following lines and then click `Save`:
```
use_pretrained_model = strtobool(conf.get("use_pretrained_model", "false"))
self.epistemic_enabled = strtobool(conf.get("epistemic_enabled", "true"))
```
<img src="./screenshots/edit_config_save.png" width="400">

*Note: the name and path of the configuration file is different for MONAI Label v0.3 and v0.4. E.g., for DeepEdit in radiology apps, it's `/apps/deepedit/main.py` for v0.3 and `/apps/radiology/lib/configs/deepedit.py` for v0.4.*

*Note: some settings can also be set by using `--config` in `monailabel start_server` command (see [doc](https://docs.monai.io/projects/label/en/latest/installation.html), click on lower right button to switch between different MONAI Label versions), so you don't have to modify the configuration file. The way to use `--config` in `monailabel start_server` might be different for different MONAI Label versions.*


Start a MONAI Label server for your chosen application and dataset:
```
singularity exec --nv -B /blue/vendor-nvidia/hju/monailabel_samples:/workspace /apps/nvidia/containers/monai/monailabel/ monailabel start_server --app /workspace/apps/deepedit --studies /workspace/datasets/Task03_Liver/imagesTr 
```

If you're using `self.epistemic_enabled = strtobool(conf.get("epistemic_enabled", "true"))`, you'll see epistemic score calculation in server output:

<img src="./screenshots/epistemic_output.png" width="800">

*Note: in the live demo, the Epistemic strategy didn't work, restarting the MONAI Label server solves the issue.* 

Once the output shows the server is up, go to 3DSlicer tab, switch to MONAI Label module, and connect with the server by putting the correct compute node name (e.g.,`c45a-s13` in `hju@c45a-s13`) in field `MONAI Label server:`:

## **step 4. Use MONAI Label server and client 3DSlicer to annotate data & train models**
**Please refer to [MONAI Label Deep Dive Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtoSVSQ2XzyD4lc-lAacFBzOdv5Ou-9IA).** *Note: the version of MONAI Label and 3DSlicer used in this tutorial is older than the one used in the videos. There's difference in MONAI Label plugin layout in 3DSlicer and MONAI Label sample application scripts.*

Phase 1. Train from scratch (no pre-trained model).
- Use 3DSlicer's internal tool (e.g., segment editor's grow-from-seeds functionality) and/or MONAI Label's scribbles to create annotation.
- Submit label and train.

Phase 2. Train with a pre-trained (not perfect) model.
- Use DeepEdit to interactively improve auto segmentation.
- Submit label and train.

Phase 3. Inference by a perfect model.

*Note: In `3DSlicer`, to use the `Option` section in MONAI Label plugin panel, make sure you go to top menu `Edit` -> `Application`, then click `MONAI Label` on the left panel and check `Developer Mode`:*
